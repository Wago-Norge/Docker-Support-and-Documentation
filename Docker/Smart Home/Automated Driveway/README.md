# Automated Driveway
This document will illustrate an example project of how automation can be applied to a home, garage and driveway. This project
uses a Wago PFC200 to observe weather forecasts and control heating. The project uses traditional controller programming, but
also includes newer, less conventional and object-oriented approches. The meaning of this project, is to illustrate how these
newer approches can be used, while still having the more traditional and "safe" ways as a base.
